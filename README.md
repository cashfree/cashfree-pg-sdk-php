# Documentation

## Creating a CFConfig instance

The CFConfig type consists of properties that are necessary for every method call that is exposed by the SDK. The following code snippet can be used to create a CFSession instance :-

```
$cfConfig = new CFConfig(CFEnvironment::SANDBOX, "1246921cc3ba7f37c7d3babbc2296421", "91aec11bc730e17d3f0df528c4a25782d0e9d6cb");
```

`Note:` CFEnvironment is an enum consisting of 2 values -> `PRODUCTION` and `SANDBOX`
`Note:` CFConfig also comes with extra options where you can set the "proxy" and "timeout" values as well.

## Create a CFHeader instance

The CFHeader type consists of properties that are sent in the headers as part of every request and they are optional values. The following code snippet can be used to create a CFHeader instance :-

```
$cfHeader = new CFHeader("x_request_id", "x_idempotency_key");
```

`Note:` These 2 values are optional.

## Create an Order with Cashfree

To process any payment on Cashfree PG, the merchant needs to create an order in the cashfree system. An order can be created using the following code snippet :

```
try {

            $cfConfig = new CFConfig(CFEnvironment::SANDBOX, "APP_ID", "SECRET_KEY");
            $cfHeader = new CFHeader("x_request_id");

            $data = [
                "order_id" => "order_id"
                "order_currency" => "INR",
                "order_amount" => 1,
                "customer_details" => [
                    "customer_id" => "customer_id",
                    "customer_name" => "customer_name",
                    "customer_email" => "customer_email",
                    "customer_phone" => "customer_phone"
                ],
                "order_meta" => [
                    "notify_url" => "https://localhost",
                ],
                // order_tags" => [],
                // "order_splits" => []
                "order_note" => "some order note here"
            ];

            $cfOrderRequest = new CFOrderRequest($data);

            $apiInstance = new CFPaymentGateway();
            $result = $apiInstance->createOrder($cfConfig, $cfHeader, $cfOrderRequest);
            print $result->getCFOrder();
        } catch (ApiException $e) {
            echo $e->getResponseBody();
        }
```

`Note:` For more information about order properties, visit [here](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/create-order#curl-request).

## Pay Order

Once you have created the order, you can use the order to initiate payment. Order creation API returns "order_token" which contains information about the order and that has to be used in payment initiation stage. Cashfree provides multiple payment methods to choose to make payments for an order, namely, UPI, Netbanking, Wallet, Card, Card EMI, Cardless EMI and Pay later.

### Card

Below is the code to initiate payment with Card

```
try {

            $cfConfig = new CFConfig(CFEnvironment::SANDBOX, "APP_ID", "SECRET_KEY");
            $cfHeader = new CFHeader("x_request_id");

            $data = [
                "order_id" => "order_id"
                "order_currency" => "INR",
                "order_amount" => 1,
                "customer_details" => [
                    "customer_id" => "customer_id",
                    "customer_name" => "customer_name",
                    "customer_email" => "customer_email",
                    "customer_phone" => "customer_phone"
                ],
                "order_meta" => [
                    "notify_url" => "https://localhost",
                ],
                // order_tags" => [],
                // "order_splits" => []
                "order_note" => "some order note here"
            ];

            $cfOrderRequest = new CFOrderRequest($data);

            $apiInstance = new CFPaymentGateway();
            $result = $apiInstance->createOrder($cfConfig, $cfHeader, $cfOrderRequest);
            
            // USE THIS TOKEN IN ORDER PAY
            $orderToken = $result->getCFOrder()->getOrderToken();

            $card = [
                "channel" => "link",
                "card_number" => "4111111111111111",
                "card_expiry_mm" => "12",
                "card_expiry_yy" => "23",
                "card_holder_name" => "Test",
                "card_cvv" => "123"
            ];
            $paymentMethod = [
                "card" => $card
            ];

            $data = [
                "order_token" => $orderToken,
                "payment_method" => $paymentMethod
            ];


            $cfOrderPayRequest = new CFOrderPayRequest($data);

            $result = $apiInstance->orderPay($cfConfig, $cfHeader, $cfOrderPayRequest);
            echo $result->getCFOrderPayResponse();
        } catch (ApiException $e) {
            echo $e->getResponseBody();
        }
```

`Note:` Order has to be created and then the order_token has to be used to make the payments for all the other payment methods as well. This step is covered in the above example and the same step has to be followed for all other payment methods.

```
try {
            $cfConfig = new CFConfig(CFEnvironment::SANDBOX, "APP_ID", "SECRET_KEY");
            $cfHeader = new CFHeader("x_request_id");

        $data = [

            ]
        ];

            
            $cfLinkRequest = new CFLinkRequest($data);

            $apiInstance = new CFPaymentGateway();
            $result = $apiInstance->createPaymentLinks($cfConfig, $cfHeader, $cfLinkRequest);
            echo $result->getCFLink();
        } catch (ApiException $e) {
            echo $e->getResponseBody();
        }
```

## Get Payment Links By LinkID

A Payment link which was created can be retrieved using this API by specifying the `LinkID`. Below is the code snippet to get the payment link information.

```
try {
            $cfConfig = new CFConfig(CFEnvironment::SANDBOX, "APP_ID", "SECRET_KEY");
            $cfHeader = new CFHeader("x_request_id");


            $apiInstance = new CFPaymentGateway();
            $result = $apiInstance->getPaymentLinkDetails($cfConfig, $cfHeader, "link_id");
            echo $result->getCFLink();
        } catch (ApiException $e) {
            echo $e->getResponseBody();
        }
```

## Cancel Payment Link

A created payment link can be cancelled using the below code snippet.

```
